## CSS

#### Methodologies

I use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) for CSS methodologies. Based on State of CSS 2019, BEM is the most popular methodologies used by the developers.

#### Traditional CSS

For styling, I'm not using SASS or LESS but traditional CSS. For grid or responsive I use Flexbox.

## UI Design

For the UI design I made myself using Sketch from scratch inspired by saveral hosting or cloud providers website but not yet with UX Research.

Here the design https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5e5e73d918f99772bb60661d.
